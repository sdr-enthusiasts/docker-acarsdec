Docker container for running [airframe's fork of acarsdec](https://github.com/airframesio/acarsdec) and forwarding the received JSON messages to another system or docker container. Best used alongside [ACARS Hub](https://github.com/fredclausen/acarshub).

Builds and runs on `amd64`, `arm64`.

Please note: **DUE TO LIBSDRPLAY, ARM32 IS NOT SUPPORTED**

## Required hardware

A computer host on a suitable architecture and one USB RTL-SDR dongle connected to an antenna.

## ACARS Hub integration

The default `SERVER` and `SERVER_PORT` values are suitable for automatically working with ACARS Hub, provided ACARS Hub is **on the same pi as the decoder**. If ACARS Hub is not on the same Pi, please provide the correct host name in the `SERVER` variable. Very likely you will not have to change the `SERVER_PORT`, but if you did change the port mapping on ACARS Router (and you will know if you did) please set the server port correctly as well.

## SoapySDR device string

The SoapySDR device string is used to identify your RTL-SDR dongle. The default value is `driver=rtlsdr` which is suitable for most users. If you are using a different SDR, you will need to provide the correct device string. For example, if you are using an Airspy Mini, you would set `SOAPYSDR=driver=airspy`. Pass any additional options for the SDR in via this option as well.

Supported Soapy Drivers:

- `rtlsdr`
- `rtltcp`
- `airspy`
- `sdrplay`

## Output modes

TL;DR: No change to your setup is necessary for continued functionality, but you should update your configuration to use the new variables and at least use TCP.

A recent change in the container has meant we are migrating from `SERVER`/`SERVER_PORT` to `OUTPUT_SERVER`/`OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT` as a better name for what the variable is representing. The old variables will continue to work for the time being, but please update your configuration to use the new variables. Simply replace `SERVER` with `OUTPUT_SERVER` and `SERVER_PORT` with `OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT`. If you do not have `SERVER`/`SERVER_PORT` set, you do not need to do anything and it will work as it did before.

Generally speaking for a proper migration, whatever your `SERVER` was before should be set in your compose as `OUTPUT_SERVER` and whatever your `SERVER_PORT` was before should be set as `OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT`. If `SERVER` was not set, you do not have to add in `OUTPUT_SERVER`. If you did not have `SERVER_PORT` set in your compose, you do not have to add in `OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT` unless you want to use `zmq`.

Additionally, the `OUTPUT_SERVER_MODE` variable has been added to allow for the output mode to be set. The default is `udp` and the container will function as it did before. `tcp` and `zmq` are also valid options and recommended over `udp` for reliability.

To use `tcp` with `acars_router` with the default ports it would have mapped, simply set `OUTPUT_SERVER_MODE=tcp` and leave the `OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT` as `5550` or unset.

If you wish to use `zmq` with `acars_router` with the default ports it would have mapped, simply set `OUTPUT_SERVER_MODE=zmq` and set `OUTPUT_SERVER_PORT` as `35550`.
